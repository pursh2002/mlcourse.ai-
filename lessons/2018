Here we cover the main idea that makes it possible to efficiently train simple linear models with very large datasets. 
We cover Stochastic Gradient Descent and its applications to classification and regression. Finally, we implement an SGDRegressor (A8 demo)

Some directions to choose when you have covered basics of Machine Learning: 
- deep learning (cs231n) 
- theory of ML 
- more practice, Kaggle 
- first job in Data Science 
- pet projects
