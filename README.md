# mlcourse.ai- September 2, 2019. 
mlcourse.ai is an open Machine Learning course by OpenDataScience.The course is designed to perfectly balance theory and practice. You can take part in several Kaggle Inclass competitions held during the course. 

Author: Arina Lopukhova (@erynn). Edited by Yury Kashnitskiy (@yorko) and Vadim Shestopalov (@vchulski).
You can ask your questions in two special threads :arrow_down:  Vadim @vchulski.
you can freely write to #mlcourse_ai  BUT please use threads :thread-please:

To follow the course schedule and all deadlines, calender : https://bit.ly/2HB9378

you watch lectures on your own, solve quizzes (mostly based on the material in articles), then we'll have several live sessions (YouTube as well) where we discuss questions in quizzes. 

1st quiz will be published on September 9, 
follow announcements in the #mlcourse_ai_news channel.
