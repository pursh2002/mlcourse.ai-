Hi and welcome to mlcourse.ai! :tada:
1st assignment
The first assignment is now live: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Yorko/mlcourse.ai/blob/master/jupyter_english/assignments_fall2019/assignment1_pandas_olympic.ipynb (if you're not comfortable with GitHub yet, just download the content of this notebook as plain text - button "Raw" on GitHub in the upper-right corner - and save as an .ipynb file). You shall now be familiar with Jupyter Notebooks, if not, go to https://mlcourse.ai/prerequisites.
In the 1st assignment, you'll analyze the history of Olympic games with Pandas. The task is to fill all missing code and choose answers in a web-form (the link is there in the notebook). Deadline: September 15, 20:59 CET (London time). You can ask your questions in two special threads :arrow_down:  Vadim @vchulski cordially accepted my invitation to help you with your questions (only in special threads, do not write him directly).
General rules
To use Slack efficiently, get help and help others, and not irritate anybode, please adhere to these simple rules:
- before asking a question, first check pinned items :pushpin: and use search (Ctrl + F). Most probably, your question was already asked and answered
- you can freely write to #mlcourse_ai  BUT please use threads :thread-please:. Do not turn this channel into yet another floody stream of thoughts. The more you flood, the more you irritate others, the lesser help you get in the end of the day
- do not share solutions in any form (files, code, GitHub, Kaggle Kernels). We don't ask you to formally sign an Honor Code, but we believe you're responsible enough not to spoil the idea of competition by leaking solutions
- do not write to me or TAs directly. Do not think your questions are so unique and important that they need to be specially processed by the team. Use this channel insted. If you're sure there are bugs or typos in course materials, you can open an issue on GitHub https://github.com/Yorko/mlcourse.ai/issues
- it's very important that you specify only one email address in all web-forms. Just choose one right now, preferably, the one mentioned in the first survey form (you''ll soon get emails with ~ the same announcement as here). Your name shall also be filled in the same everywhere.

Lectures
Almost all lectures are already there in this YouTube playlist https://bit.ly/2zY6Xe2, only a couple will be added. This time the course sticks to the "inverted classroom" paradigm - you watch lectures on your own, solve quizzes (mostly based on the material in articles), then we'll have several live sessions (YouTube as well) where we discuss questions in quizzes. 1st quiz will be published on September 9, follow announcements in the #mlcourse_ai_news channel.
